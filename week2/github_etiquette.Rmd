Keep file names short and concise. Don't use funky characters and spaces in file names.

When adding a commit message, begin by using your name so we know who edited the file, e.g. "Erika updated the RMarkdown file".

**Always pull before you push** so that you don't accidentally delete someone's work.

Keep tutorial files organised into the corresponding weekly folder.
